All assignment submissions must be as PDFs, a non-editable format that ensures that we see your work as you intended it to be seen. Exporting a Word document to PDF is a simple process on both Macs and PCs.

<h2>Using Microsoft Word to Save as PDF</h2>

The process for saving a Word document as a PDF using Microsoft Word is the same for both Macs and PCs:

<ol>
	<li>Go to "File &gt; Save Asâ€¦" in the menu bar;</li>
	<li>Select "PDF" in the "Save as Type" dropdown in the save dialog;</li>
	<li>Click "Save".</li>
</ol>

<h2>Alternative: Printing to PDF (Mac only)</h2>

<strong>NOTE: The following method may cause issues if your document has both portrait and landscape pages. Be sure to make sure that your PDF contains <em>all </em> printed pages before submitting.</strong>

If you are using a Mac, you can use its built-in "Print to PDF" functionality to turn any document into a PDF.

<ol>
	<li>Go to "File &gt; Print"</li>
	<li>Click the arrow next to "PDF" in the bottom left corner of the print dialog;</li>
	<li>Click "Save".</li>
</ol>
