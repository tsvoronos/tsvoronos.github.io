As you all know, we will be using Zoom for all of our class sessions for the remainder of the semester. Here is some guidance, both logistical and pedagogical, that I encourage you to read before our first Zoom session.

<h1 id="before-the-session">Before the Session</h1>
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure that you have the <strong>Zoom app downloaded on your computer</strong> (we will <strong>not</strong> be using the web interface). The easiest way to do this is to go to <a href="https://harvard.zoom.us/download">https://harvard.zoom.us/download</a> and download the application.
<ul>
 	<li>If you would like (though this is not necessary), you can log in to the desktop application using this process (click Sign in with SSO, and type harvard.zoom.us). <a href="https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&amp;sys_id=2b591402db367704dffdbc32ba9619ff">Details here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Go to <a href="https://pollev.com/login">https://pollev.com/login</a> and <strong>log in or sign up to create a Poll Everywhere account</strong>. You will have to be logged in to use Poll Everywhere while we’re remote so that I can better attribute questions to students.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
 	<li>First, <strong>download the handout</strong> from the course Home Page on Canvas. I am posting them as both a PDF or Word document. You can write on this with your computer/tablet, or print it out to write on it during the session.</li>
 	<li>To access Zoom <strong>click on the Zoom tab</strong> in the left navigation area of our Canvas site. You should see a list of sessions - click “Join” to enter the session.
<ul>
 	<li><em>You must have installed Zoom and logged in to enter the session.</em></li>
</ul>

</li>
 	<li><strong>Please use your computer to access Zoom</strong> - I will be broadcasting two screens as I do in class, so it’s important that you have a large enough screen to be able to see the content.</li>
 	<li>Once you are in session, make sure that <strong>your video is on</strong> and that <strong>your audio is working but is muted</strong>.
<ul>
 	<li><em>You can test your video and audio by going to preferences in the Zoom app.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="during-a-session">During a Session</h1>
Use the “<strong>Nonverbal Feedback</strong>” buttons to express yourself during the session.
<ul>
 	<li>Click “<strong>Participants</strong>” in your Zoom window to see the icons that you have access to.

</li>
 	<li>Your primary mode of feedback will be the “<strong>Raise Hand</strong>” button. If I call on you, I will unmute you so that you can answer or ask a question.</li>
 	<li>You can also use the <strong>go slower</strong> button if you’re feeling confused, and the <strong>yes</strong> and <strong>no</strong> buttons to respond to questions that I ask. Click “<strong>more</strong>” to see additional reactions.

</li>
 	<li>At various times throughout each session, I will pause for questions. I’ll use a special <strong>Poll Everywhere Q&amp;A poll</strong> to solicit questions, and you can also “vote up” questions that you others pose that you also have. You can access this poll at any time by going to <a href="http://bit.ly/api202zquestions">bit.ly/api202zquestions</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="after-a-session">After a Session</h1>
After some processing time (this take up to an hour or two), you can access a recording of the session by going to the Zoom tab on our Canvas page and clicking “Cloud Recordings”
