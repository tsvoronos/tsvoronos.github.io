# Welcome!

 Iâ€™m a [Senior Lecturer in Public Policy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/teddy-svoronos) teaching statistics and working on [integrating technology and pedagogy](teaching). I am increasingly focused on questions of [training effectiveness](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/person/teddy-svoronos) and [creating inclusive classrooms](teachly). I also study the intersection of [health policy and program evaluation](publications). Sometimes I [write about tech and teaching](blog). Take a look around, and please feel free to get in touch.
