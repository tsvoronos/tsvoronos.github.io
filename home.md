# Welcome!

 Iâ€™m a [Senior Lecturer in Public Policy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/teddy-svoronos) teaching statistics and working on [integrating technology and pedagogy](teaching). I am increasingly focused on [generative AI and learning](https://policylab.hks.harvard.edu/projects/pingpong.html) and [creating inclusive classrooms](teachly), and do research on [both](publications). Sometimes I [write about tech and teaching](blog). Take a look around, and please feel free to get in touch.
