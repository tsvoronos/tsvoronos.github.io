Iâ€™m a <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/teddy-svoronos"><strong>Lecturer in Public Policy</strong></a> teaching statistics and working on <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/teaching/"><strong>integrating technology and pedagogy</strong></a>. I am increasingly focused on questions of <strong><a href="https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/person/teddy-svoronos">training effectiveness</a></strong> and <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/teachly/"><strong>creating inclusive classrooms</strong></a>. I also study the intersection of <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/publications/"><strong>health policy and program evaluation</strong></a>, particularly for <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/spark/"><strong>communities in developing countries</strong></a>. Sometimes I <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/posts/"><strong>write about tech and teaching</strong></a>.

Take a look around, and please feel free to get in touch.
