I made a short video illustrating the Zoom settings that I believe are well-suited for my style of teaching. I'm assuming students are using around a 13" laptop without an external monitor. If you think your students would find this useful, please feel free to share!

Big thanks to Liana Woskie for pretending to be my student!
