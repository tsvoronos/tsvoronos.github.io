Yesterday I was featured on [WBUR's All Things Considered](https://www.wbur.org/upnext/2025/09/25/artifical-intelligence-ai-education-college-harvard) to talk about my current approach to generative AI in the classroom. We talk about the promise of these tools for learning, the very real risks they pose, and what I think AI companies, teachers, and students should do differently.

I've been quiet on here for some time, but hoping to start posting more on my generative AI work!
