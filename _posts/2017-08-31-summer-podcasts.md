This summer I was lucky enough to guest on two podcasts.

## MPU

The first was a return visit to [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/383). We got into the nitty gritty of the teaching workflows that I’ve developed in the past year, including: 

  * How I set up reminders that alert me during class when it’s time to move on to the next section;
  * How I automate the creation of teaching reflections after every class;
  * How I combine PDF files to post to my class via Workflow.

We also got into some music nerdery towards the end. 

All in all it was great fun, and hopefully interesting to listeners. 

## Teaching in Higher Ed

My second guest appearance was on the [Teaching Higher Ed podcast](http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/effectively-use-presentation-tools-teaching/), hosted by Bonni Stachowiak. This one was much more pedagogy-oriented, and focused on presentation techniques that I have found to be useful as a teacher.

Hope you enjoy them, and please get in touch if you have feedback.
