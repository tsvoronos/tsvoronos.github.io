This summer I was lucky enough to guest on two podcasts.
<h2>MPU</h2>
The first was a return visit to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/383">Mac Power Users</a>. We got into the nitty gritty of the teaching workflows that I’ve developed in the past year, including:
<ul>
 	<li>How I set up reminders that alert me during class when it’s time to move on to the next section;</li>
 	<li>How I automate the creation of teaching reflections after every class;</li>
 	<li>How I combine PDF files to post to my class via Workflow.</li>
</ul>
We also got into some music nerdery towards the end. All in all it was great fun, and hopefully interesting to listeners. the
<h2>Teaching in Higher Ed</h2>
My second guest appearance was on the <a href="http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/effectively-use-presentation-tools-teaching/">Teaching Higher Ed podcast</a>, hosted by Bonni Stachowiak. This one was much more pedagogy-oriented, and focused on presentation techniques that I have found to be useful as a teacher.

Hope you enjoy them, and please get in touch if you have feedback.
