My journey through the world of podcasts continues, this time on the [Teach Better Podcast](http://teachbetter.co/blog/2017/10/09/tbp-episode-64/) (an excellent podcast that you should check out if you have any interest in pedagogy and higher ed). This one has (almost) no technology in it. Instead we discuss a collaborative exam structure called Two Stage Exams, and the pedagogical benefits of adopting it in my courses. Later on we get into more general questions of collaboration and student participation in large classes, a conversation that Iâ€™m still thinking about. 

Enjoy!
