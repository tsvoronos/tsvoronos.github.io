As I prepare for my Spring semester, one of my biggest wins from the Fall was my use of Slack as a clearinghouse for discussions, announcements, and questions related to my course. I made this short video summarizing how I used it.

_Would love to hear other suggestions for what has worked for you in your teaching!_
