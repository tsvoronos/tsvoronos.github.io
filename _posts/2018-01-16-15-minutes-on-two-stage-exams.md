I delivered a short presentation on two-stage exams[^1] at the [Harvard Initiative for Teaching and Learning Annual Conference](https://hilt.harvard.edu/resources2017conf) back in September. I've [talked about these](http://teddysvoronos.com/2017/10/10/collaborative-exams-on-the-teach-better-podcast/) in the past, but this time (a) there's more of a focus on quantifying collaboration, and (b) there are some neat visuals that I couldn't show on a podcast. Video below.

[^1]: Iâ€™m increasingly calling these collaborative exams. We'll see if that sticks.
