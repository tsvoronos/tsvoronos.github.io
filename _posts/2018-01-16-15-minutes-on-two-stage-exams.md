I delivered a short presentation on two-stage exams<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> at the <a href="https://hilt.harvard.edu/resources2017conf">Harvard Initiative for Teaching and Learning Annual Conference</a> back in September. I've <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/2017/10/10/collaborative-exams-on-the-teach-better-podcast/">talked about these</a> in the past, but this time (a) there's more of a focus on quantifying collaboration, and (b) there are some neat visuals that I couldn't show on a podcast. Video below.
