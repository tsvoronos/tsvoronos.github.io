<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>The bad news</h2>
<p>The reason for this is that <strong>Zoom is constantly making tradeoffs between quality (resolution) and smoothness (framerate) to optimize video, and in doing so is making a lot of assumptions about the nature of your video</strong>. In short, it assumes that you want your webcam to be smooth at the expense of quality (it's weird to have choppy video of you talking) and your screen sharing to prioritize quality at the expense of smoothness (you're often showing a static image with text on it, and that text must be readable).</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see the problem already - if you're sharing your slides with you overlaid on top of them, you want your slides to be high quality and your video camera to be smooth. But since you're just piping in a single virtual camera into Zoom, it's treating your feed like a webcam - smooth and low quality, making it difficult to read text.</p>
<h3>The worse news</h3>
<p><strong>This problem has gotten worse since COVID hit</strong>, since the huge pressure on Zoom's infrastructure has led them to essentially disable the sharing of a webcam in HD regardless of your settings (<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207347086-Group-HD">accessed September 7, 2020</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: As our world comes together to slow the spread of COVID-19 and stays connected through Zoom globally, we are working to quickly scale our bandwidth during this unprecedented demand.</p>
<p>For the time being, standard video, not HD video, will be activated when 3 or more participants join a group meeting. HD video (720p) will be activated for 2 participants or when a Zoom Room or Conference Room Connector joins a group meeting. HD video (1080p) will only be activated for selective use cases such as large format broadcast events.</p>

<p>That means that your webcam will pretty much always be transmitted at 360p in any classroom setting.</p>
<h3>The even worse news</h3>
<p>The part that concerns me the most is that <strong>it's difficult to test this on your own</strong>, since (a) On your computer, Zoom shows your local uncompressed video feed so it looks fine to you; and (b) The nature of its compression changes as more people join.

<h3>A (kind of) workaround</h3>
<p>One way to get around this issue is to use an option in Zoom's Advanced Screen Sharing window called &quot;Content from 2nd Camera&quot;:</p>
