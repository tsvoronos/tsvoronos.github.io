I was recently featured on OpenAI's new ChatGPT for Education Substack, where I discuss a custom bot that I created to help my statistics students practice core skills needed to succeed in my course. Read all about it, and see the full prompt, [here](https://openaiforeducation.substack.com/p/teaching-with-chatgpt-personalized).

The post all mentioned a study that I'm currently involved in where we are studying the effects of an AI tutorbot on student outcomes in STEM courses. This bot has guardrails to help orient students toward learning, and allows you to see anonymized transcripts of student interactions with your bot.
