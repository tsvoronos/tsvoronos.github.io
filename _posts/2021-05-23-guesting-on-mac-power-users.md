Last week I was lucky enough to be invited back to the Mac Power Users podcast for the third time (previous visits [here](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/319) and [here](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/383)). This time we focused heavily on video conferencing for obvious reasons, and I talked about some tips related to Zoom window management, making use of multiple screens, not to mention my [troubles with virtual cameras](https://teddysvoronos.com/2020-09-07-the-promise-and-peril-of-virtual-cameras-on-zoom/).

Though perhaps it’s being released later than optimal in terms of utility to the readers of this blog, I do hope you give it a listen and share any thoughts in the Comments below or [on the MPU forum](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/589-zoom-jiu-jitsu-with-teddy-svoronos/23467/2).

Enjoy!

**Update**:*During the episode we talk about a image of my setup that I shared, but looks like it didn’t make it into the show notes. Here it is below:*
