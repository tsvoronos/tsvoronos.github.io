<p>Last week I was lucky enough to be invited back to the Mac Power Users podcast for the third time (previous visits <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/319">here</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/383">here</a>). This time we focused heavily on video conferencing for obvious reasons, and I talked about some tips related to Zoom window management, making use of multiple screens, not to mention my <a href="https://teddysvoronos.com/2020/09/07/the-promise-and-peril-of-virtual-cameras-on-zoom/">troubles with virtual cameras</a>.</p>

<p>Though perhaps it’s being released later than optimal in terms of utility to the readers of this blog, I do hope you give it a listen and share any thoughts in the Comments below or <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/589-zoom-jiu-jitsu-with-teddy-svoronos/23467/2">on the MPU forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:<strong> </strong>During the episode we talk about a image of my setup that I shared, but looks like it didn’t make it into the show notes. Here it is below:</p>
