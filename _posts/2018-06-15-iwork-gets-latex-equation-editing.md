In [April of last year](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH26382?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US), Apple released an update for Pages that supported rendering equations entered using LaTeX or MathML. I was really impressed that Apple chose to support not one but _two_ standards for entering equations[^1], but was pretty bummed to learn that equation rendering was specific to Pages.

Today that changed. All three iWork apps now support equation rendering (even Numbers!). This is a big, big deal for me; it’ll be a huge timesaver[^2] and enable for much richer math-based animations in my presentations.

If you combine this with handwriting apps like [MyScript Nebo](https://www.myscript.com/nebo/), you can hand draw equations, copy them as LaTeX code, and paste them right into your iWork document. 

On a different note, iWork on iOS is really growing up. Keynote now supports the editing and creation of paragraph styles and master slide layouts. I still work with Keynote most efficiently on MacOS, especially when editing animations in bulk, but the iOS apps are becoming more and more self-sufficient with each update.

[^1]: Especially in comparison to Microsoft’s equation syntax, which is just close enough to LaTeX to be infuriating to use.
[^2]: I used to create equations in a Pages document, then pasted them into Keynote as images. It worked, but it was kludgy as heck.
