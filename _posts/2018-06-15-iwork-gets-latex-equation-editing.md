In <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH26382?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=en_US">April of last year</a>, Apple released an update for Pages that supported rendering equations entered using LaTeX or MathML. I was really impressed that Apple chose to support not one but <em>two</em> standards for entering equations<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, but was pretty bummed to learn that equation rendering was specific to Pages.

Today that changed. All three iWork apps now support equation rendering (even Numbers!). This is a big, big deal for me; it’ll be a huge timesaver<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and enable for much richer math-based animations in my presentations.

If you combine this with handwriting apps like <a href="https://www.myscript.com/nebo/">MyScript Nebo</a>, you can hand draw equations, copy them as LaTeX code, and paste them right into your iWork document.

On a different note, iWork on iOS is really growing up. Keynote now supports the editing and creation of paragraph styles and master slide layouts. I still work with Keynote most efficiently on MacOS, especially when editing animations in bulk, but the iOS apps are becoming more and more self-sufficient with each update.
