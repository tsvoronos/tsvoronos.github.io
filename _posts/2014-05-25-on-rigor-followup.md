<p>This is a followup to my <a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/2014/02/23/on-rigor-2/" title="On Rigor | Teddy Svoronos">previous post</a> on external validity and rigor, and a further attempt to pretend that this blog is not just about productivity, apps, and hacks.</p>

<p>Jed Friedman has a <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/towards-more-systematic-approach-external-validity-understanding-site-selection-bias" title="Towards a more systematic approach to external validity: understanding site-selection bias | Impact Evaluations">great piece</a> on the Development Impact blog on a <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18373" title="Site Selection Bias in Program Evaluation">working paper by Hunt Alcott</a> (who I cited in my previous post). Alcott describes a concept called &ldquo;External Unconfoundedness&rdquo;. This perfectly articulates what I was trying to get at in my previous post, an attempt to bring statistical notions of unbiasedness to questions of external validity. A lot of the conditions for external unconfoundedness have to do with the environment of the original study, and Alcott is particularly interested in site selection bias - the extent to which the setting for a study is chose because of favorable conditions.</p>

<p>Both the working paper and the post are great reads.</p>
