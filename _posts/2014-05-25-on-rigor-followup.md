This is a followup to my [previous post](http://teddysvoronos.com/2014/02/23/on-rigor-2/) on external validity and rigor, and a further attempt to pretend that this blog is not just about productivity, apps, and hacks.

Jed Friedman has a [great piece](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/towards-more-systematic-approach-external-validity-understanding-site-selection-bias) on the Development Impact blog on a [working paper by Hunt Alcott](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18373) (who I cited in my previous post). Alcott describes a concept called "External Unconfoundedness". This perfectly articulates what I was trying to get at in my previous post, an attempt to bring statistical notions of unbiasedness to questions of external validity. A lot of the conditions for external unconfoundedness have to do with the environment of the original study, and Alcott is particularly interested in site selection bias - the extent to which the setting for a study is chose because of favorable conditions.

Both the working paper and the post are great reads.
