A recurrent problem during my statistics course last semester was that it was difficult for students to share handwritten work, diagrams, and drawings when I sent them into breakout rooms to work on a particular problem.

I've documented the various ways I [use a tablet to handwrite](https://teddysvoronos.com/2020-03-20-teaching-from-home-tfh-writing-on-a-tablet/) in my courses on this website. The problem is, these methods presuppose the sharer owning a tablet, and often requires the use of paid software to make it work effectively. For students who need a free and easy way to share handwriting, this won't work. Instead, I recommend using an app that lets you mirror your phone's camera (with some additional features) via screensharing, to use it as a bespoke document camera:

  * **[Overviewer (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1528900395):** This app relies on [Zoom's built-in iOS sharing function](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client) (either wirelessly or wired) to mirror a direct camera feed. It also gives you the option to rotate the orientation of your camera, something you can't do with the built-in camera app. [The developer](https://overviewer.app) produced the following video walking you through how to use it:

  * **[Vysor (Android)](https://www.vysor.io):** this is a desktop app (available on all platforms) that will mirror your Android phone's screen onto a computer window, which you can then share using Zoom's [window sharing](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-content-or-second-camera) feature. It's less elegant than Overviewer, but it seems to work. Here's a video of Richard Byrne setting up and using it ([full post here](https://www.freetech4teachers.com/2021/01/how-to-use-your-android-phone-as.html)):

The final step is positioning your phone appropriately. While you can certainly buy a nice [gooseneck phone holder](https://www.amazon.com/gooseneck-phone-holder/s?k=gooseneck+phone+holder), a stack of books will do as well (the developer of Overviewer [addresses this here](https://youtu.be/fadOMMpQErg?t=337)):
