<p>While discussing research workflows with colleagues, I&#8217;ve been surprised to hear that many get the full text of a journal article by coming across an article, navigating to their school library website, searching for the journal under E-Resources, clicking on the journal link, digging down to the article of interest, and downloading it.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way (usually).</p>

<p>In most cases, links to journal pages through your library&#8217;s website are identical to their ordinary link + a suffix (called an EZproxy) that validates your school credentials to check if you have access. Thus, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>http://jama.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx
</code></pre>

<p>Your library&#8217;s link will look something like:</p>

<pre><code>http://jama.jamanetwork.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/journal.aspx
</code></pre>

<p>Your browser can make this change through what&#8217;s called a &#8216;bookmarklet,&#8217; a bookmark that, when clicked, does something with the existing URL in your browser. For my case, creating a bookmark with the following script as its content will redirect a journal&#8217;s site through my school library:</p>

<pre><code>javascript:void(location.href='http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url='+location.href)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can simply drag this <a href="javascript:void(location.href='http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url='+location.href)">EZproxy</a> link into your browser bar.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://ezproxy-db.appspot.com/">a list of different schools&#8217; EZproxy URLs</a>. Edit the code above by replacing <code>http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url=</code> with your school&#8217;s URL.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that if you click this after trying to access a full PDF:</p>

<p>You get this:</p>

<p>Now, the caveat: this will not work for certain journals<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. This may be because your school accesses that journal through some larger database, in which case you may have to go back to your library website, <em>like an animal</em>. But this works for me most of the time; hope you find it useful.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Note that this may simply be because your school doesn&#8217;t have access to that journal. Ugh, I know. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
