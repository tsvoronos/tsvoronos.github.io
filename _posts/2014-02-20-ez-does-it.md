While discussing research workflows with colleagues, I've been surprised to hear that many get the full text of a journal article by coming across an article, navigating to their school library website, searching for the journal under E-Resources, clicking on the journal link, digging down to the article of interest, and downloading it. 

It doesn't have to be this way (usually). 

![(Almost) never again.](/assets/img/2014-08-no-access.jpeg)

<p>In most cases, links to journal pages through your library&#8217;s website are identical to their ordinary link + a suffix (called an EZproxy) that validates your school credentials to check if you have access. Thus, instead of:</p>

```
http://jama.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx
```

<p>Your library&#8217;s link will look something like:</p>

```
http://jama.jamanetwork.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/journal.aspx
```

Your browser can make this change through what&#8217;s called a &#8216;bookmarklet,&#8217; a bookmark that, when clicked, does something with the existing URL in your browser. For my case, creating a bookmark with the following script as its content will redirect a journal&#8217;s site through my school library:

```
javascript:void(location.href='http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url='+location.href)
```

Alternatively, you can simply drag this <a href="javascript:void(location.href='http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url='+location.href)">EZproxy</a> link into your browser bar.

Here&#8217;s <a href="http://ezproxy-db.appspot.com/">a list of different schools&#8217; EZproxy URLs</a>. Edit the code above by replacing <code>http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url=</code> with your school&#8217;s URL.

In practice, this means that if you click this after trying to access a full PDF:

You get this:

Now, the caveat: this will not work for certain journals[^1]. This may be because your school accesses that journal through some larger database, in which case you may have to go back to your library website, <em>like an animal</em>. But this works for me most of the time; hope you find it useful.

[^1]: Note that this may simply be because your school doesn&#8217;t have access to that journal. Ugh, I know.
