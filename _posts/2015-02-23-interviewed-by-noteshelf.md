<p>I was interviewed by the makers of <a href="http://www.noteshelf.net" target="_blank">Noteshelf</a>, one of the first (of many) handwriting apps that I bought on the iPad. Though I&#8217;ve since switched to <a href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com" target="_blank">GoodNotes</a> for its more advanced features, Noteshelf is the app that has come closest to emulating an actual notebook and pen in my experience.</p>

<p>You can find the interview <a href="http://noteshelf-blog.tumblr.com/post/110119906963/a-phd-student-jazz-guitarists-take-on-his" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
