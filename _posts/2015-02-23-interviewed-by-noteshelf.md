I was interviewed by the makers of [Noteshelf](http://www.noteshelf.net), one of the first (of many) handwriting apps that I bought on the iPad. Though I've since switched to [GoodNotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com) for its more advanced features, Noteshelf is the app that has come closest to emulating an actual notebook and pen in my experience.
