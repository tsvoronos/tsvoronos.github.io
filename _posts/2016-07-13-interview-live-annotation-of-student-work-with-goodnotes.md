I was recently interviewed on <a href="http://ablconnect.harvard.edu/home">ABLConnect</a>, a Harvard-based “online database of active learning efforts in post-secondary classrooms.” I talk about my use of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-4-notes-pdf/id778658393?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lcfa">GoodNotes</a> to take pictures of student work in class, embed them into a GoodNotes document, and annotate them without skipping a beat. It's a great tool to get students to engage with the material in a collaborative way.
