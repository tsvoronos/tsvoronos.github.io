A [very enjoyable post on the regression discontinuity study design](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/regression-discontinuity-porn) over at the must-read [Development Impact](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations) blog. I was lucky enough to introduce this design to a room full of policy master's students this semester, and I agree completely with all of Evans' points. In addition to being a conceptually interesting design, RD is a great way to introduce students to the rationale behind [quasi-experimental studies](http://www.amazon.com/Experimental-Quasi-Experimental-Designs-Generalized-Inference/dp/0395615569).
