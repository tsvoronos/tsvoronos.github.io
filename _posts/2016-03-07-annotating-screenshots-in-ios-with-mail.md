<p>Gabe Weatherhead has <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/03/redaction-and-annotation-with-pixelmator-for-ios.html">an awesome post</a> about how he uses <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lcfa">the awesome Pixelmator</a> to annotate screenshots. It&#8217;s awesome. </p>

<p>Gabe&#8217;s discussion of the limitations of all the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pointout-show-what-you-mean!/id985172637?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lcfa">many</a> different <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinpoint-mark-up-screenshots/id669858907?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lcfa">existing</a> iOS <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnigraffle-2/id899656932?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lcfa">apps</a> to annotate screenshots got me thinking about another option: <a href="http://www.iphonejd.com/iphone_jd/2015/09/markup-ios-9.html">the Markup extension in iOS Mail</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to being built in, the Markup extension has some nice properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>it has excellent shape recognition, including arrows;</li>
<li>it&#8217;s pressure sensitive using 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and the Pencil on the iPad Pro;</li>
<li>it has a very simple and easy to use interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s just one big downside to markup: for reasons I cannot fathom, it&#8217;s only available in Mail<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. This is in spite of the fact that it exists in the action extension share sheet in Mail:</p>

</figure>

<p>Despite this major limitation, the usability of the markup extension makes it worth using by sharing a photo via Mail, then saving the sent image back to your photo library.</p>

<p>First, share an image via Mail and tap on the image to get the Markup option (I sometimes have to tap it more than once):</p>

</figure>

<p>You can then edit the image to your heart&#8217;s content including shapes (notice the nice shape recognition option at the bottom), text, and even a magnifier callout:</p>

</figure>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, you can either send it to yourself and save/share the image from iOS mail, or you can use <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/394053-send-a-photo-to-your-photo-library">this handy dandy IFTTT recipe</a> to email it to IFTTT which saves it back into your photo library, annotated and all. A bit roundabout, but it works.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>That&#8217;s right, not even Notes or Messages. Maybe in iOS 10? <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
